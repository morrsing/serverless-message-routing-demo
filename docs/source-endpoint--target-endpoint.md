# Deploying a Source Endpoint-to-Target Endpoint Route with Simulators
![Source Endpoint to Target Endpoint Diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f12f301f-messaging-demo/diagrams/source-endpoint--target-endpoint.png "Source Endpoint to Target Endpoint Diagram")

Deploy the route using the following steps:

  1. Deploy a Source Endpoint: [![Deploy to AWS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f12f301f-messaging-demo/misc/deploy_to_aws.png "Deploy to AWS")](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=messaging-source-endpoint&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/f12f301f-messaging-demo/templates/source-endpoint.yaml)
  2. Deploy a Target Endpoint: [![Deploy to AWS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f12f301f-messaging-demo/misc/deploy_to_aws.png "Deploy to AWS")](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=messaging-demo-target-endpoint&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/f12f301f-messaging-demo/templates/target-endpoint.yaml)
  3. Deploy a route between the source and the target: [![Deploy to AWS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f12f301f-messaging-demo/misc/deploy_to_aws.png "Deploy to AWS")](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=messaging-demo-source-ep-target-ep&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/f12f301f-messaging-demo/templates/source-endpoint--target-endpoint.yaml)

## Source Endpoint Template Parameters
The Source Endpoint template requires several parameters. The following are required:
  * **Stack name:** Provide a unique name for this CloudFormation Stack. The Stack Name is used to generate names for various aspects of the task, service, security groups, and other resources, so you should ensure that the Stack Name a unique identifier among your deployed Stacks, as well as other resources in your region.
  * **BatchSize:** How many messages to send for each request of the endpoint. Setting this number small will help you to trace messages as they move across a route.
  * **EcsClusterArn:** The ARN of the Fargate cluster you created previously. If you used the template provided above, the ARN is available as an output of the CloudFormation stack.
  * **VpcId:** The VPC within which the Fargate cluster runs. If you created a Fargate cluster using the above template, the VPC ID is an output.
  * **SubnetIds:** A comma separated list of subnets within which the Fargate cluster runs. If you created a Fargate cluster using the above template, the subnet IDs are available as outputs.
  * **LogLevel:** A log level for output from the source. By default, `verbose` is selected and is recommended.

Additionally, one of the following two parameters must be provided:
  * **ExecutionRoleArn:** Provide the ARN of an IAM Role that contains the `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` or equivalent. This is optional; CloudFormation can create the Role on your behalf if you leave this blank and specify `ExecutionRoleName` instead.
  * **ExecutionRoleName:** The name of a new IAM Role that will contain the `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` IAM Policy. This is optional; CloudFormation can use an existing IAM Role if you provide it in the `ExecutionRoleArn` parameter.

## Target Endpoint Template Parameters
The Target Endpoint template requires several parameters. The following are required:
  * **Stack name:** Provide a unique name for this CloudFormation Stack. The Stack Name is used to generate names for various aspects of the task, service, security groups, and other resources, so you should ensure that the Stack Name a unique identifier among your deployed Stacks, as well as other resources in your region.
  * **EcsClusterArn:** The ARN of the Fargate cluster you created previously. If you used the template provided above, the ARN is available as an output of the CloudFormation stack.
  * **VpcId:** The VPC within which the Fargate cluster runs. If you created a Fargate cluster using the above template, the VPC ID is an output.
  * **SubnetIds:** A comma separated list of subnets within which the Fargate cluster runs. If you created a Fargate cluster using the above template, the subnet IDs are available as outputs.
  * **LogLevel:** A log level for output from the source. By default, `verbose` is selected and is recommended.

Additionally, one of the following two parameters must be provided:
  * **ExecutionRoleArn:** Provide the ARN of an IAM Role that contains the `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` or equivalent. This is optional; CloudFormation can create the Role on your behalf if you leave this blank and specify `ExecutionRoleName` instead.
  * **ExecutionRoleName:** The name of a new IAM Role that will contain the `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` IAM Policy. This is optional; CloudFormation can use an existing IAM Role if you provide it in the `ExecutionRoleArn` parameter.

## Route Template Parameters
The Source Endpoint-to-Target Endpoint route requires the following parameters:
  * **Stack name:** Provide a unique name for this CloudFormation Stack. The Stack Name is used to generate names for various aspects of the API Gateway and other resources, so you should ensure that the Stack Name a unique identifier among your deployed Stacks, as well as other resources in your region.
  * **SouceEndpoint:** The source endpoint URL, which is an output of the Souce Endpoint template. This is the URL from which messages are requested.
  * **SourceRequestMethod:** The HTTP method for requesting messages from the `SourceEndpoint`, which is an output of the Source Endpoint template.
  * **TargetEndpoint:** The target endpoint URL, which is an output of the Target Endpoint template. This is the URL where routed messages are POSTed.
